# Image-denoising-with-Non-Local-Means-
This project uses the Non Local Means algorithm to perform image denoising. The noise added to the original image is of Gaussian and Salt &amp; Pepper type, and the denoised images with Non Local Means algorithm and a simple Gaussian Smoothening filter are compared.
